# Domain Puppy

**AI-powered domain brainstorming and availability checking — right in your terminal.**

Domain Puppy is a Claude Code skill that turns your terminal into a domain research powerhouse. Brainstorm hundreds of creative names, check availability in seconds, and find aftermarket gems — all without leaving your editor. Claude activates it automatically when you mention needing a domain, or you can invoke it directly.

---

## What It Does

- **Brainstorm with AI** — Generate hundreds of domain name ideas across 7 naming categories using 10 proven techniques
- **Instant availability checking** — RDAP lookups run in parallel batches, no API key required
- **Batch check 50–100+ domains in seconds** — parallel checking means no waiting around
- **Premium aftermarket search** — Find already-registered domains for sale via Fastly Domain Research API (5 free checks/month per user)
- **Affiliate-powered registration links** — Domains link directly to [name.com](https://www.name.com) for registration and [Sedo](https://sedo.com) for aftermarket purchases

---

## Installation

**Universal (works everywhere — terminal, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.):**

```bash
curl -sL domainpuppy.com/install | sh
```

**Or via the skills CLI:**

```bash
npx skills add mattd3080/domain-puppy
```

That's it. Start a new conversation and say "find me a domain for [your idea]" — Domain Puppy activates automatically.

---

## Usage

### Flow 1: Check a specific domain

```
is brainstorm.com available?
```
or invoke directly:
```
use domain puppy — check brainstorm.com
```

Domain Puppy checks availability across a 10-TLD matrix and returns results:

```
✅ brainstorm.io       — Available — Register at name.com
❌ brainstorm.com      — Taken
✅ brainstorm.ai       — Available — Register at name.com
❓ brainstorm.co.uk    — Status unknown (ccTLD)
```

### Flow 2: Brainstorm mode

```
/domain
> brainstorm
> A project management tool for remote teams
```

Domain Puppy generates waves of names — Quick Wave (fast ideas), Standard Wave (refined variations), Deep Dive (creative combinations) — checking availability for each batch as it goes.

## Privacy Policy

> Domain Puppy does not log, store, or analyze the domains you search for. Our proxy processes your request and discards it. We only track aggregate usage counts to manage our free tier quota.

Additional details:

- **Availability checks** use MCP tool calls routed through a Cloudflare Worker to RDAP/WHOIS registries — no domain data is stored
- **Premium search via proxy** — your domain is forwarded to Fastly's Domain Research API and not stored by us
- **Playwright fallback** — when the premium quota is exhausted, the skill can optionally scrape registrar pricing pages with explicit user consent (one-time opt-in per session)

---

## Architecture

```
/domain (Claude Code skill)
    |
    +-- Availability:  MCP tool call → Cloudflare Worker → RDAP/WHOIS registries
    |
    +-- Premium:       MCP tool call → Cloudflare Worker → Fastly Domain Research API
    |
    +-- Fallback:      Playwright → registrar pricing pages (user opt-in, when API quota exhausted)
```

1. The skill file runs entirely within Claude Code — no daemon, no background process
2. Availability checks use MCP tool calls (`mcp__domain_puppy__check`) routed through a local MCP server to the Cloudflare Worker, which queries RDAP/WHOIS registries
3. Premium aftermarket search uses MCP tool calls (`mcp__domain_puppy__premium_check`) routed through the same Cloudflare Worker to the Fastly Domain Research API
4. When the free premium quota is exhausted and the user opts in, the skill can use Playwright to scrape registrar pricing pages directly as a fallback

---

## Worker Infrastructure

The Cloudflare Worker proxy (`worker/src/index.js`) sits between free-tier users and the Fastly Domain Research API. It protects against runaway usage and abuse.

### Deployed Endpoints

- `POST /v1/premium-check` — Premium domain status via Fastly/Domainr (IP-quota limited)
- `POST /v1/whois-check` — WHOIS availability for 13 ccTLDs without RDAP support

Base URL: `https://domain-puppy-proxy.mattjdalley.workers.dev`

### Protection Layers

Requests pass through guards in this order:

| Layer | What it does | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **IP rate limit** | Blocks burst abuse from a single IP | 10 requests/minute per IP |
| **Monthly circuit breaker** | Disables premium search for all users when global usage is too high | 8,000 requests/month (configurable via `MONTHLY_QUOTA_LIMIT`) |
| **Per-IP quota** | Limits free checks per user | 5 checks/month per IP (configurable via `FREE_CHECKS_PER_IP`) |

All guards use Cloudflare KV for state and **fail open** — if KV is unavailable, requests pass through rather than breaking the product.

### Circuit Breaker Details

- Counter key: `circuit:monthly:{YYYY-MM}` in KV
- Trips at `MONTHLY_QUOTA_LIMIT` (default: 8,000) total requests across all users
- Resets automatically each calendar month (KV TTL: 60 days)
- When tripped, returns HTTP 503 — the skill handles this gracefully and falls back to free RDAP/WHOIS/DNS checks
- **Alert webhook**: When the breaker trips, fires a one-time POST to `ALERT_WEBHOOK` (if configured) with a notification message. Works with Slack, Discord, or any HTTP endpoint.

### Known Limitations

- **KV eventual consistency**: Cloudflare KV writes can take up to 60 seconds to propagate globally. Under heavy concurrent load, the circuit breaker could overshoot by a few hundred requests before all edge nodes see the updated counter.
- **No edge rate limiting on workers.dev**: Cloudflare's WAF rate limiting rules only apply to custom domains, not `*.workers.dev` subdomains. To add a hard backstop at the Cloudflare edge, set up a custom domain (e.g., `api.domainpuppy.dev`) and add a rate limiting rule there.

### Secrets & Environment Variables

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FASTLY_API_TOKEN` | Secret | Server-side Fastly API token (Cloudflare secret — never exposed to clients) |
| `ALERT_WEBHOOK` | Secret (optional) | Webhook URL for circuit breaker alerts (Slack/Discord/any) |
| `MONTHLY_QUOTA_LIMIT` | Env var | Monthly request cap before circuit breaker trips (default: 8000) |
| `FREE_CHECKS_PER_IP` | Env var | Free premium checks per IP per month (default: 5) |

### KV Namespace

| Binding | Namespace ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `QUOTA_KV` | `1e8eeb0b1e13419ba18a78f29e18e96a` | IP quotas, circuit breaker counter, rate limit counters |

### KV Key Patterns

| Key format | TTL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ip:{ip}:{YYYY-MM}` | 60 days | Per-IP monthly quota counter |
| `circuit:monthly:{YYYY-MM}` | 60 days | Global monthly request counter |
| `ratelimit:{ip}:{minute}` | 120 seconds | Per-IP burst rate limit counter |

## Releasing a New Version

Domain Puppy auto-prompts users to update when a new version is pushed to main. To release:

```bash
./hooks/bump-version.sh 1.6.0    # updates all version strings in SKILL.md
git add SKILL.md
git commit -m "Release v1.6.0"
git push
```

The bump script updates the version in all three locations within SKILL.md (frontmatter, `LOCAL_VERSION`, and comment headers) in one command. The pre-commit hook will block the commit if any of them are out of sync.

Users on older versions will see a persistent update prompt until they say "update", which runs `npx skills add mattd3080/domain-puppy` to pull the latest.

---

## Self-Hosting the Worker

Contributors and teams who want to run their own proxy can deploy the Cloudflare Worker:

```bash
cd worker
npm install
wrangler kv:namespace create QUOTA_KV
# Copy the KV namespace ID into wrangler.toml
wrangler secret put FASTLY_API_TOKEN
wrangler deploy
```

Then update the worker URL in `mcp/src/handlers.js` to point to your deployed worker.

### Secret leak prevention

Install the pre-commit hook after cloning:

```bash
cp hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

The hook scans staged files for token-like patterns and blocks the commit if anything suspicious is found. Secrets must be stored in `.dev.vars` (gitignored) or as Cloudflare secrets — never in tracked files.

### Optional: Alert Webhook

```bash
wrangler secret put ALERT_WEBHOOK
# Paste your Slack/Discord/webhook URL
```

### Optional: Custom Domain + Edge Rate Limiting

For a hard backstop beyond the KV-based circuit breaker:

1. Add a custom domain to Cloudflare (e.g., `api.domainpuppy.dev`)
2. Route the worker to that domain via `wrangler.toml` or the Cloudflare dashboard
3. Add a WAF Rate Limiting rule on that zone capping `/v1/premium-check` at your desired monthly limit
